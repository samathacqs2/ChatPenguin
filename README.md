# 🐧 ChatPenguin Regression Project

This repository contains a Python-based regression project built using the **Palmer Penguins dataset**. The goal is to train and serve a machine learning model capable of predicting a numeric target based on penguin features.

## 📦 Repository Contents

- **`chatpenguin.py`**: Main script that loads the model and serves predictions (possibly using a web or CLI interface).
- **`modelo_regresion.pkl`**: Trained regression model saved using Pickle.
- **`palmer_penguins.csv`**: Dataset containing measurements for penguin species (from the Palmer Archipelago).
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages for running the project.
- **`SamiKeyPair.pem`**: PEM key file, possibly for SSH or secure access (⚠️ keep this private).
